The development of enrichment protocols for whole genome sequencing of _Treponema pallidum_ directly from patient swabs has enabled the cataloging of global allelic diversity of vaccine target genes and examination of the emergence of antibiotic resistance. As of August 20th, 2024, sequencing reads from more than 3,000 clinically-derived T. pallidum strains were available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

However, despite the public availability of _T. pallidum_ sequencing data in the SRA and similar databases, these data remain challenging to use for many stakeholders due to the extensive bioinformatics expertise necessary to extract consensus sequences and perform phylogenetic inference from thousands of strains. Only 16% of sequenced samples have a genome assembly available to the public in databases such as NCBI GenBank.

Because only genome assemblies are annotated the _T. pallidum_ vaccinology and diagnostic communities are essentially blind to these 2600 strains, outside of select analyses included for publication.

Thus, the development of a curated database of assembled genomes and of _T. pallidum_ strains coupled with a simple and intuitive user dashboard for phylogenetic and variant analysis is critical to democratize access and enable researchers worldwide to fully benefit from the rich genomic data available, especially as more _T. pallidum_ is sequenced in the future.

**This project aims to develop and maintain a custom _T. pallidum_ Nextstrain repository, featuring variant and metadata visualization in the context of a regularly updated phylogenetic tree.**
