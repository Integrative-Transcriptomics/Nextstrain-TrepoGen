    - The <code>Nucleotide diversity of the genome</code> panel provides insights into the variability of biologically relevant gene regions.
    These were either predicted using [DeepTMHMM](https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM/) or curated manually.
    Clicking on a track will zoom into this region; by clicking on the individual bars, coloring is performed according to amino acid variants instead of nucleotide variants.
    - <code>Extracellular loop</code> (ECL) amino acid sequences and the <code>Extracellular loop type</code> — the combination of translated ECL sequences — are integrated as metadata.
    To ensure robust representation, only ECL types present in at least 1% of all source samples are displayed.
    - TrepoGen gene datasets provide the view of a single gene only and do not represent a comprehensive genomic context!

      #### Tp0326

       BamA (TP0326) is the central component of the molecular machinery that inserts newly exported OMPs into the spirochete’s outer membrane.
       BamA in _Treponema palldium pallidum_ is bipartite and consists of a predicted 16-stranded β-barrel with eight extracellular loops (ECLs) and five polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains within the periplasm.
