# Nextstrain TrepoGen

> Nextstrain TrepoGen is a reproducible Nextstrain workflow for tracking bacterial diversity at both genome- and gene-level. It integrates genetic variants and sequence data with manually curated metadata, including protein topology predictions, to produce interactive phylogenies and automated per-feature typing for downstream analyses.

### ðŸŽ“ Background

Syphilis is a resurging global health threat caused by _Treponema pallidum_ ssp. _pallidum_, with additional disease burden from the closely related subspecies _pertenue_ and _endemicum_, the causative agents of yaws and bejel, respectively. By 2025 whole genome sequencing data for more than 3,000 _T. pallidum_ strains were available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. However, more than 80% of these lack publicly available genome assemblies and, more critically, systematic annotation. This severely limits their utility for molecular epidemiology, resistance surveillance, and vaccine development.

### âœ¨ Objectives

We aim at democratizing access to _T. pallidum_ genomic diversity data by developing and maintaining unified, community-facing Nextstrain datasets for epidemiological surveillance, comparative evolutionary analysis and facilitated data sharing; with a special emphasis on tracking outer membrane protein (OMP) diversity relevant for vaccine design.

### ðŸ”“ Access

Our Nextstrain datasets are currently private. Weâ€™re actively preparing to release it to the public soon and will update this repository with more details once available.

## Funding and Acknowledgments

This project is funded by the _Gates Foundation_ grant [INV-072205: To support the development of a broadly effective syphilis vaccine](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2024/12/inv-072205). We thank the authors, originators and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata for providing their work and are currently working on a comprehensive list of data provenance. Moreover, we would like to thank the Nextstrain community and the Nextstrain team for the development of the augur/auspice ecosystem and their support for the project.
